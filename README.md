# ImpactLab

This Vite React (TypeScript) project combines two apps:
- **Project A** (`src/projectA`) — Solar system canvas
- **Project B** (`src/projectB`) — Asteroid impact simulator

You can find it by link: https://impactlab.onrender.com/

Use the two buttons on the top bar to switch between apps.
